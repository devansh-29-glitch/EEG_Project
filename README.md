# EEG_Project
An end-to-end, interactive neuroscience pipeline implementing EEG signal analysis using pseudo-epochs, feature extraction, and deep learning classification,turning brainwaves into readable patterns with deep learning.

# Project Summary :- 
This project is an exploration of brainwave data (EEG) through the lens of deep learning. Using a specialized neural network architecture called EEGNet, it demonstrates how raw electrical activity from the human brain can be transformed into meaningful insightsâ€” from detecting hidden patterns in thought processes to distinguishing between different mental states. The notebook walks through the entire pipeline: preprocessing raw EEG signals, training EEGNet on real-world data, evaluating performance, and visualizing the results. To make the work transparent and interactive, the code can be run directly in Google Colab, while a static HTML version showcases the outputs and findings without needing execution. Beyond just a technical exercise, this project highlights how cutting-edge machine learning can be applied to neuroscience, bridging the gap between signals our brain generates and the technology that can interpret them.
